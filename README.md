- **Backend API**: [http://43.204.236.19:8080](http://43.204.236.19:8080)

---

## Objective

The application allows users to:

- Register and log in securely
- Create, update, delete, and manage tasks
- Filter, sort, and search tasks
- Drag and drop tasks between statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Edit tasks inline
- Experience a responsive and interactive UI with optimistic updates

---

## User Flow

1. **Registration**  
   New users sign up with their name, email, and password.

2. **Login**  
   Upon successful registration, users are directed to the login page. Valid credentials return an authentication token stored securely.

3. **Taskboard**  
   Authenticated users access the taskboard where they can:
   - View tasks in a grid grouped by status
   - Add new tasks using a validated form
   - Edit task title, description, and status inline
   - Move tasks between columns via drag and drop, enabled by an **icon** in the bottom-right of each card
   - Experience instant UI feedback via optimistic updates before the API responds

## Local Installation guidelines

Follow the steps below to run the Task Manager App locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Composer
- PHP (v8.1+)
- MySQL (or use XAMPP)
- Docker (optional for backend)
- Git

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sam002696/task-manager-app.git
cd task-manager-app
```

## Backend Setup (task-manager-backend)

```bash
cd task-manager-backend
```

1. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

2. Create .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update your .env file with your local database and app configurations:

```bash
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=task_manager
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3. Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Run migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

5. Serve the backend

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The backend should now be running at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

Optional: Use Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Frontend Setup (task-manager-frontend)

```bash
cd ../task-manager-frontend
```

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the frontend

```bash
